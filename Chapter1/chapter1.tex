\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Blocks World.} The premises in the Blocks World problem at the beginning of this chapter
	are not complete. The problem assumes some things about the world that are not explicitly recorded there.
	Write out some of these implicit assumptions as sentences in English.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each block may only have one block stacked directly on top of it (ie. no more than one block may be
			at one level).
			
		\item Each block must be ontop of another block, except the bottom block, which is on the table.
		
		\item There exists only one of each colour block.
		
		\item There exists only one tower of blocks.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \emph{Propositional Resolution.} Consider the problem of Mary, Pat and Quincy given earlier.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Encode  the assumption that Mary loves one of Pat or Quincy but not both. (Hint: the
			sentence $p \Rightarrow$ means that $p$ is false.)
			
			$$p \wedge q \Rightarrow $$
			
		\item Using this additional assumpition, use propositional resolution to prove that, if it is Monday and
			raining, then Mary does not love Pat.
			
			$$p  \Rightarrow q$$
			$$m \wedge r \Rightarrow p \vee q$$
			
			Gives
			
			$$m \wedge r \Rightarrow q$$
			
			Using propositional resolution with $p \wedge q \Rightarrow$ gives
			
			$$p \wedge m \wedge r \Rightarrow$$
